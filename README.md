# social-api

## Description

This project builds a back end for a hypothetical social network where users can share thoughts and add friends, as well as react to others' thoughts. 

## Installation

You will need node package manager (npm) and open the project in your integrated terminal. Use the command npm i to install all the dependencies needed for the project to work. You can start the server by running either node index.js or npm run start. 

## Usage

There is a walk through video of this project at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zjgntZma86cyqbcu2BYMNped3MZsrIap/view). Once you have performed npm install, you can use insomnia to perform get, post, put, and delete requests in any of the given categories. Note that there currently is no seed data for the categories so you will need to use the post requests to make it functional.

## Credits

I borrowed some of the outline and data structure for this project from our bootcamp class's miniproject to get started, and referenced multiple class modules while struggling with the controllers.
